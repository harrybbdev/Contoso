# Contoso
A simple .NET project demonstrating usage of a simple invoice system using CosmosDB as the backing data. It is not optimised for reading nor fully fleshed out, but is useful as a quick reminder of how to setup CosmosDB in .NET. 

It is also using Vertical Slice Architecture and CQRS (with Mediator) as some extra practice when it comes to implementing it by scratch.

This will be used as a base for future work, especially around the Invoicing system I am planning to create.
